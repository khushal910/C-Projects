Overview:
The Task Progress Simulator is a fun and interactive C program that simulates the progress of multiple tasks and visually displays the progress in the terminal. It uses dynamic progress bars to represent each task's completion percentage and updates them at regular intervals. 

Feature: 1. Multiple Tasks: Tracks up to 5 tasks simultaneously.
         2. Progress Bars: Each task has a dynamic progress bar that updates every second.
         3. Clear Screen: Clears the terminal screen after each update for a smooth and modern display.
         4. Random Progress: Each task progresses at a random rate, simulating different speeds of task completion.
         5. Completion Notification: Once all tasks are completed, a final message is shown.
